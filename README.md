# Tik-Tak-Toe-Bot
A simple imperative Tic Tak Toe bot written entirely in Rust. 
It is only tested on Windows 10 but should allegedly* work on MacOs, Windows 11, and Linux.

The only dependency is Console for handling keyboard input, and random for some random move generation. In the future once I implement a better algorithm, I'll remove the Rand dependency.


# Installation

You can't, yet.

But if you really want to you can dowload the source code as a zip, install cargo run cargo build --release on the folder, and then run the exe is the result file.
